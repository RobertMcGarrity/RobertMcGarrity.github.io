<p>When it pertains to technology, reliability is an extremely subjective matter, depending upon which features and benefits an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, but low signal strength and poor connection are still common problems.

<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, implying you will not be able to link it directly to other third-party gadgets like smart locks or automate specific actions in the home.
