Smart alarm systems changed that. Initially, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, usually a home alarm company. The consumer paid month-to-month charges.</p>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered. Nevertheless, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the consumer.</p>
<p>The cost of a home security system differs by provider. Some suppliers allow you to choose from pre-programmed equipment packages while others deal with you to construct a customized security system.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
