<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
