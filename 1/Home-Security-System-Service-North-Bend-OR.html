<p>Ring may not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has actually gained quite the excitement throughout the years.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the reality, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is essential.</p>
