SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would signal users when it detected any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the problem.

However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Some people might want to register for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for example.
