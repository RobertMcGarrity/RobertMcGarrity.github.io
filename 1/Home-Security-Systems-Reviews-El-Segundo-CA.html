We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect notifies). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
