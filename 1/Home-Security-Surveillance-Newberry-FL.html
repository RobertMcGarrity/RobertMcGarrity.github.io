The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Renters, unlike homeowners, usually prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits.
