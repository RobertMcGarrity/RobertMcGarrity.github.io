<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to keep and for how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by.
