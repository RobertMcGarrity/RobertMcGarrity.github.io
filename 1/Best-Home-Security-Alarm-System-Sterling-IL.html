<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you stroll by.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
