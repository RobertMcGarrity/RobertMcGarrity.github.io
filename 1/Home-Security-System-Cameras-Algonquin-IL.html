These cameras record everyone similarly: the general public setting about their day-to-day activities, and wrongdoers who likely shield or mix themselves in to avoid being taped or found.

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
