The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the destructive assailant to tape these codes and utilize various breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security essential caught throughout the network healing.</p>
