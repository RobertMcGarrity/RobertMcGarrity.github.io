<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed properties) a pricey and ineffective  technique to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>

The first guard got here early so he might take a look at the entire location and talk with me about my concerns. He was expert, extremely reassuring and courteous.
