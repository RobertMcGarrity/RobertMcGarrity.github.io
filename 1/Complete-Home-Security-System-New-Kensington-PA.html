<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? If so, having a hardwired security system installed might be a much easier and more affordable option. However if your home currently has no pre-wired security system, a wireless one gets rid of the requirement for drilling into your walls and also provides you the alternative of a DIY install.
