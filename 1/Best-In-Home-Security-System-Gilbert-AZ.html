<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is really easy to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.

<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
