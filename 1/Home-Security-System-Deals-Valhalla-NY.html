<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
