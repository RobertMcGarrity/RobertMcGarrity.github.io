<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
