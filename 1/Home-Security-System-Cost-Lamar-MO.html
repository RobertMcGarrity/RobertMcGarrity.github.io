<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, must provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording spaces during important security events. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise one of our top picks, but the Arlo is excellent for signing in on family and pets-- or roaming felines sliding around your backyard.</p>
