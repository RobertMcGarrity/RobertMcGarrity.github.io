<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
