<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
