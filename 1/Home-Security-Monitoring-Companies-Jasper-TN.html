Night vision: Most burglaries happen after dark, so this feature is nearly as essential as motion detection.

Be that as it may, some camera's will change to night vision immediately in low-light conditions, while others allow you to personalize when and how it must be activated.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision option, however the black and white variation can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality video footage.

For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded.
