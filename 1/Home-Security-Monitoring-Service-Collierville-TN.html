<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Tenants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also permit push-button control of the system and basic home automation.
