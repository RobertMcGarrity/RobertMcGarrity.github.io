<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that can finding tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based on details about the temperature differences.
