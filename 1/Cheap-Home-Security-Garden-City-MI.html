Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines shout, felines shriek, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
