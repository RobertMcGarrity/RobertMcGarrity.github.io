If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive technique to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
