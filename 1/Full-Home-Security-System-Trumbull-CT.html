<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.

A self-monitored home limitations the potential for false alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
