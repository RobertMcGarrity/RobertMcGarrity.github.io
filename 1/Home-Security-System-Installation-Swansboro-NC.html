<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
