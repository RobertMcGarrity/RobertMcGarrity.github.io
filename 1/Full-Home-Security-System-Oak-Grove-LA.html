<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
