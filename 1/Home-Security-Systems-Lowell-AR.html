<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary advantages like individual detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 monthly.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine).
