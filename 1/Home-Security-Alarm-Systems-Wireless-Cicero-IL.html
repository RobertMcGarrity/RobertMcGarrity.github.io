<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire communities (all taxpayers fund police response to alarmed homes) a expensive and ineffective  approach to break-in decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
