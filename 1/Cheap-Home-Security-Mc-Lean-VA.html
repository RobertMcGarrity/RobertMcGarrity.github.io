(For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smart device or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to mount the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
