<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>Maybe you have children and require to include cameras to the nursery. As your children grow, it's simple to develop out your system by including cameras in any areas where your kids require monitoring. That's just $1.25 a day (or about $38 a month) for all of your Ring Alarm equipment, a Ring Video Doorbell, and a whole year of expert monitoring. Catastrophe protection - you can link a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide alarm to the app. Disadvantage: some systems have a high rate of false alarms because some of these sensing units might be too sensitive.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
