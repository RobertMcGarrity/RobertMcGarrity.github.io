<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This choice is typically cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is usually a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend on just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a must for usage when you're away from home, however you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going.
