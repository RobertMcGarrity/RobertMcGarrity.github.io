<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
