So we had to purchase new cameras.</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>
