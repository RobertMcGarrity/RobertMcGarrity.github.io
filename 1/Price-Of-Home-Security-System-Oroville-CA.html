It gets an Excellent ranking for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
