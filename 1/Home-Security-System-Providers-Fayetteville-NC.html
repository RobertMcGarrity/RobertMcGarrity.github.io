<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
