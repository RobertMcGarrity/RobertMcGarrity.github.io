It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send voice warnings through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of approximately one year of battery life.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've labeled (after a learning period).

<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds person detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, sometimes, less false informs. If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area, you will not need to stress over it tape-recording or sending an alert whenever the canine walks by. (We think this is a more valuable feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars regularly pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Camera.</p>
