<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
