These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
