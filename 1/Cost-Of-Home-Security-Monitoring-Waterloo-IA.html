<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to resolve the problems with WEP.

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
