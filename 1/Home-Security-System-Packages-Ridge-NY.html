(For a take a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your mobile phone or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to install the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>
