<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Package because it includes all the essentials (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a couple of extra entry sensing units. Ring recommends this plan for homes with approximately two bedrooms and around 2,000 square feet.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
