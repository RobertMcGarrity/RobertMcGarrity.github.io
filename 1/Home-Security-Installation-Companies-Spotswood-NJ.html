<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
