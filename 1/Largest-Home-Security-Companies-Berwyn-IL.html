<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
