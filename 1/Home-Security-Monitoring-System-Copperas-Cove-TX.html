The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 monthly for person detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and features storage approximately 31 days.</p>

And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
