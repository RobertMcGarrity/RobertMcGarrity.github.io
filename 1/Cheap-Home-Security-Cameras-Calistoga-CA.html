<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensing units to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources.

However, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for individual detection with one month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and functions storage up to 31 days.</p>

On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
