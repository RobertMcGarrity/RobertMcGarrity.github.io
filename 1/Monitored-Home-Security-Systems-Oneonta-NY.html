In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Guidelines such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
