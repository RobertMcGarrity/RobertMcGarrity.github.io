<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, giving them their name and an unique look. This look is recognizable to almost everybody and thus serves as a deterrent to undesirable individuals. The hope is bad guys and burglars go elsewhere rather if security cameras are visible. That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism because of their apparent look. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is ideal for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires numerous cameras if a user needs to see multiple fixed views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that includes weather protection and reduces glare.</p>

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
