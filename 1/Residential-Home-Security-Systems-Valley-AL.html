However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey technique to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
