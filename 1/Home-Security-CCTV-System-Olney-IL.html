This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, however if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more versatile. Contact sensors are the first thing you need to buy together with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will signal you when they open. Other home security components include motion sensors, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensors, and panic buttons.</p>
