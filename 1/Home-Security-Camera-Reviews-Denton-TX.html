<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime avoidance created to avoid both personal and property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Many apps also allow you to do things like view live and tape-recorded unlock, lock and video doors, change thermostat settings, and silence alarms. Some apps will even use your phone's area services to instantly equip and disarm the system according to your physical location. The more pricey systems normally include a wall-mounted panel that functions as a communications center, with a touch-screen screen that permits you to do whatever the app does. The screen lets you interact with an expert monitoring service when an alarm is activated and view video from any of the installed security cameras.</p>
