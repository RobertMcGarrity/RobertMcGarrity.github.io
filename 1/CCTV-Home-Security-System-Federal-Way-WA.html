<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less likely to commit crime if they think they are being seen or have a greater danger of being collared. This is likewise known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be decreased by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to devote the crime, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet.
