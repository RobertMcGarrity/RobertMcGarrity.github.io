<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to fix detail after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a lot of recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they require about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to record the exact same length of video footage.
