<p>Sensors enable cameras to begin and stop recording based on time or motion detection. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is between recording and detecting movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it finds motion because the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording. If a wicked bad guy was quickly enough, they could surpass the camera prior to it had time to record them. Cellular phone can also now be utilized to from another location set and unset alarms via apps.</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
