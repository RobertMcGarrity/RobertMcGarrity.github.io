<p>ADT lets you create distinct codes for each individual who utilizes your alarm, and it sends you mobile notifies when someone arms or disarms your system.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
