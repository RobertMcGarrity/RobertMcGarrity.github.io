<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved money on a remote server run by the maker, rather of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras save recordings in your area on a microSD card or a connected disk drive.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by.
