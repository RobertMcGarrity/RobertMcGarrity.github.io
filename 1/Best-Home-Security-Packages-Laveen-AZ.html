When people are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself."
