<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
