<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
