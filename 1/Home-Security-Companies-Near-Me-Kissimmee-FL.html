Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
