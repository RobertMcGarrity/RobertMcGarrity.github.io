<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and reduce crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we might review this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The large face of the camera gives you an excellent field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to wait to the cloud.)
