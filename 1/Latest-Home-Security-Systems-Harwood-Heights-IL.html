<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
