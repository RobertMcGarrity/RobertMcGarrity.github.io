Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs shout, cats shriek, babies cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
