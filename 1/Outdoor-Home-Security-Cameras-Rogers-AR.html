<h2>Security Camera Systems For The Home Rogers</h2>
<p>The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can make sure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far goes beyond the limited benefits that the system might supply in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
