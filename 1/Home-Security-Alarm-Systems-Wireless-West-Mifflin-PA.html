<p>When it comes to how to utilize one, they work the same as a lot of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. In some cases you do not even have to hardwire them, depending on which model you pick. Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the pricier it gets. When you add wise cameras to any Blue system, and that cost leaps a lot. We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, however every smart camera Blue deals is $200.</p>
<p>Arlo Pro 2 also has an impressive Night Vision feature. It is equipped with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of exposure in the evening. As such, even if someone breaks into your home in total darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your mobile phone app. The only problem here is that the tape-recorded video footage will be black and white and a little dark so you might not be able to see details plainly.</p>

<p>Among IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the tape-recorded video footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
