<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
