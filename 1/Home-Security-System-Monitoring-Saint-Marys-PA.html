<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or 2 in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range issues.</p>
