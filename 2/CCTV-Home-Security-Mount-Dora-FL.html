<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal worth. It gets an Outstanding score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video in your area on an SD card.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
