<p>Thanks to recent developments in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you have actually decided to install an alarm system, you should think about the following benefits of wireless technology. The $260 Basics bundle includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensing units, one motion sensing unit, a lawn sign, and two window decals.
