Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by.
