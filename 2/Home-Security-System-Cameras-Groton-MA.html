The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to save and how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

<p>Besides resolution, likewise consider the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, however not all angles are produced equal. Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge range in terms of the camera's vision cone. If you wish to watch a big area, you ought to think about a camera with a very wide field of view. The capability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a great asset also.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in consumer reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo up to 32 feet. And even though the app and software application are easy to work with, it's a little bit of a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any smart home hubs or gadgets. A lot of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function without any aggravation.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic.
