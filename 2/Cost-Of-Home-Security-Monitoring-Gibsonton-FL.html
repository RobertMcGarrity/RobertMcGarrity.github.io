<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was nearly as simple to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if among the sensing units had actually been set off. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect signals). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
