<h3>Best Home Security Service in New Jersey</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

For example, you may require a control board with 10 sensors versus the four sensors that might include other packages. Or, you may need various types of sensors such as those that monitor ecological catastrophes and other household dangers like fire and carbon monoxide, etc. Or maybe you are a senior and would like to include a medical alert button and the associated equipment to your security system.</p>
