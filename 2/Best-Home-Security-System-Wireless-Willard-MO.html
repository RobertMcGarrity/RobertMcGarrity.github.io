Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional info that may never have actually been possible previously, such as alert of a worker, by name and identification number, getting in the structure. An image of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>
