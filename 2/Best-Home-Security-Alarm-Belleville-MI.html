To achieve practically anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when dealing with global and national business. The exact same applies for security and video surveillance.

<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
