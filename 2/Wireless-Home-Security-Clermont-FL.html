<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a typical camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is essential.</p>

Transmitters can also be connected through the facilities' electrical circuits to send coded signals to the control unit (line carrier).
