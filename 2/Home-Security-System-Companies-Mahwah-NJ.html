<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader location and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it discovers an intruder; a helpful intercom function that permits the gadget to serve as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
