However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
