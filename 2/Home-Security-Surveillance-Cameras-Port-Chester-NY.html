CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to anger can be reduced by altering a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit must understand the added surveillance for it to attain its preferred result.</p>
