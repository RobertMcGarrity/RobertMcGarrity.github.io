The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the problem.

<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having problem. This is a simple switch that is usually open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that understands the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
