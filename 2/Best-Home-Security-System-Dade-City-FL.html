We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect signals). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
