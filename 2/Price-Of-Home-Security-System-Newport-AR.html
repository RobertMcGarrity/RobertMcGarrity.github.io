Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public locations may serve as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being recorded, though probably not enjoyed.</p>

And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the first year.
