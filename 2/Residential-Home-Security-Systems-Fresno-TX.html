<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might discover to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members."

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
