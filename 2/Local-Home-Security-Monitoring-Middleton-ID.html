<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server run by the maker, instead of at your house) is the norm nowadays, but some cameras store recordings in your area on a microSD card or a connected hard disk drive.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
