<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
