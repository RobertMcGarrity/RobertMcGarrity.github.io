<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All objects discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy discharged by a things is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that can detecting small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Due to the fact that objects are rarely precisely the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
