<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security personnel. Several cities likewise require a permit to even run a home and own security system.

Commercial cameras outperform their less expensive cousins because they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and record outstanding low light video.</p>
