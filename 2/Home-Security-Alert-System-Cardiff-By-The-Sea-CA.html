When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.

<p>This nifty wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when motion was spotted. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly.
