The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the reality, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage area.
