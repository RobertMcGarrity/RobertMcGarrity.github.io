<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home parts in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, placement is more flexible. Contact sensing units are the very first thing you need to buy alongside the base station; these attach to windows and doors and will alert you when they open. Other home security components include motion sensors, keypads, crucial fobs, cameras, glass-break sensing units, and panic buttons.</p>
