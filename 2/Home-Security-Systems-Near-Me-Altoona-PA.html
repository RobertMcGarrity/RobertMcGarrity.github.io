<p>While every house owner worries about burglaries, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a totally free mobile phone app that permits residents who see something suspicious to take an image and rapidly send it to public safety authorities. For example, a public transit rider may observe somebody behaving suspiciously. Many people are messing, texting or surfing with their mobile devices.

Some zones might set off a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with information of which room might be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that present video of the intrusion area can be quickly shown on a remote monitor, not to point out recorded.</p>
