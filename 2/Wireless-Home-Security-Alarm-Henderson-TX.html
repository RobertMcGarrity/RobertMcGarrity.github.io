An Internet procedure camera is a digital camera that sends out and gets data via a computer system network. This varies from a CCTV camera, which can only send and get signals through a cable linked to a DVR.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.

Instead, you turn signals on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or trigger the siren.
