Here's a take a look at the basic elements of a common CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We started with 16 cameras & have grown to 25 cameras.

For instance, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the client.
