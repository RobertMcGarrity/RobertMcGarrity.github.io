<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal construction.

Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
