<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
