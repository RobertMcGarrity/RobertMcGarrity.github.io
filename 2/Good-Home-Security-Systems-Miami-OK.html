<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
