Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
