<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
