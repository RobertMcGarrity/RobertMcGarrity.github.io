<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.

<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Excellent clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my mobile phone however had a couple concerns that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for 1 month of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the initial cost.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
