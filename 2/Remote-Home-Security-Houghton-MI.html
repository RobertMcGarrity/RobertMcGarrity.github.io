<h3>Security System Installation Houghton MI 49931</h3>
<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can choose whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you pick to have your cameras monitored (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered. However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is normally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer.</p>
<p>The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit less expensive than the wireless systems. While this might seem appealing in the beginning, think about all of the drawbacks to the wired systems that we have actually already discussed. It's easy to get set up with Allied's alarm monitoring services. Physical security is critical for your employees, consumers and everyday operations. Using innovative, integrated technologies we style, install and monitor an individualized commercial burglar alarm system for companies and institutions of all sizes.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
