<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cables. DVR systems are difficult to scale up because once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to purchase a completely new DVR prior to including another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the connected cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
