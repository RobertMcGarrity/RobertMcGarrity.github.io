<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most tough setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your email address. Then you enter the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi info. (You need to play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets shout, felines shriek, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
