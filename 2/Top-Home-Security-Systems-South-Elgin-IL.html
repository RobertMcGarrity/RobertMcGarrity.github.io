I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative wise home enthusiasts or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't devote to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>A bigger security company that continually monitors your home will have a designated station that sees thousands of homes and companies at the same time. They cost more because they need to go through confirmation with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), an independent, non-profit company that focuses on testing services and products to make sure optimum dependability and safety. The Element Thermostat includes a minimalist design, humidity sensing units, voice control, and Vivint Smart Home app combination. It uses geolocation, at home sensing units, local environment and household information to adjust itself and promote energy preservation while you're far from home.</p>

So is the plan for recordings from several cameras: $10 a month or $100 a year.</p>
