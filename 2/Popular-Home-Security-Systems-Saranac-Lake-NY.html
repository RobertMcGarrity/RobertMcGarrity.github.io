<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
