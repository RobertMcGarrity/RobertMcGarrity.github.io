<p>While you're doing your shopping, keep in mind that you can develop a clever security system piece by piece: fitting a network of wireless cameras is no longer the expensive one-and-done overhaul that it used to be. Today's systems can be modified and expanded as necessary. There are several alternatives for night vision cameras available. Most of them are cost-efficient yet highly practical. Go for designs that take advantage of infrared (IR) technology if you're looking for night vision cameras that supply the brightest and best night view. Some designs are designed to activate the IR innovation immediately depending upon the light conditions. Furthermore, guarantee the camera has 100 feet of night vision or more.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
