<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet.
