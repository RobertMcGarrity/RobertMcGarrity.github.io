<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
