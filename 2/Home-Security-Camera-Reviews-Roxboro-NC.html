<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
