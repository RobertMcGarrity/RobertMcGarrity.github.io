It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video locally on an SD card.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually excellent. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
