<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even activate false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place regularly enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>

Keep in mind: a good alarm system is a financial investment in your security and individual well-being. The mere existence of an alarm is often a deterrent. Market the reality that your home or business is alarmed by utilizing a warning decal.</p>

Both the original House system and the Abode Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we checked that also works with HomeKit. We have actually come across a couple of technical concerns while long-term screening the Residence Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade accordingly. We no longer advise it.</p>
