<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive modifications to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might learn to be cautious about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the environments underwent extended surveillance.</p>
