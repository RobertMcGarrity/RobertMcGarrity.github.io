<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

<h3>Security Alarm Equipment Silverton OR 97381</h3>
<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support cops action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
