We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors.

DVRs likewise need that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to deteriorate.</p>
