<p>Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the internet. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the recorded video footage is saved in the cloud.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
