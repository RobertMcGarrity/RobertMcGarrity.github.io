<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<h3>DVR Security Camera System Cedar Hill MO 63016</h3>

The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
