<h2>CCTV Installation And Security Systems Beecher</h2>
<p>If you are not sure about whether the wireless CCTV camera type will operate in a specific location, a good idea is to inspect it with your smart device.

<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR.
