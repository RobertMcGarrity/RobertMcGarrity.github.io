<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy DIY installation, other companies offer (and sometimes require) expert installation. Expert installation is readily available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.

<p>Flood lights are often used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensing units identify movement, the lights illuminate the surrounding location, which will allow you to see who is on your home and will potentially scare off intruders.

Flood lights can discourage vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
