Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
