<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
