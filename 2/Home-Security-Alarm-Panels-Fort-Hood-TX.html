We have actually discovered good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, however you'll find more than 30 brands available. In some cases you do not have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT provide just expert installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a DIY alternative. ADT doesn't have the strongest customer care credibility among the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this approximately the truth that ADT has a number of million more customers than its competitors, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>

However, an exception can be made for home security systems that feature benefits like the ADT Mover's Cost savings Package, which permit you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends upon the provider, but you can prepare for signing an agreement with providers who require professional installation of their systems. The typical length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements could cover approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would suggest thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system instead if you want to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>
