This is also referred to as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be lowered by altering a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the offender needs to understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted result.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
