<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? If so, having a hardwired security system set up might be a much easier and more economical choice. But if your home currently has no pre-wired security system, a wireless one gets rid of the requirement for drilling into your walls and also provides you the alternative of a DIY install. While wireless home security systems are popular and understood for a simpler, more structured installation, hardwired systems are more trusted because they aren't subject to interference.</p>

The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. The tuning of the system is generally accomplished throughout commissioning of the detection gadgets.</p>
