<p>Entryways and exits - Security cameras positioned at the entrances and exits to your business will track not just who enters your business, but how long they stay.

They link to the company's particular app, so you're always in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensors cost just $44.99 and use 3 to 5 times more variety than ADT's and Vivint's.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
