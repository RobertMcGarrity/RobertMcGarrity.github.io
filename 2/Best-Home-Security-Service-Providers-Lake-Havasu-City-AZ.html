Nest Aware memberships are priced per camera, and if you want to pull out of paying for storage altogether, Nest only offers you approximately three hours worth of recordings. Wired security systems are connected by hard-wired cable televisions and require access to power outlets, making them harder to place and install.

<p>The home security market offers numerous plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to discourage intruders who trigger a door or window sensor.
