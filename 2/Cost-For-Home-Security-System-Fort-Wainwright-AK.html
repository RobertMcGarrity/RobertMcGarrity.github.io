<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep taped video. The footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another key element of a camera-- the greater the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is just a series of still images sewn together to create a movie. The lower the frame rate, the less often a still is taken; this leads to choppier footage. You'll wish to think about the frame rate of the camera you acquire before deciding. For recommendation, "real time" is usually measured as 30 frames per second.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
