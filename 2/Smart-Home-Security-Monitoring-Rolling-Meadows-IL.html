<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to store and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video footage. The video is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
