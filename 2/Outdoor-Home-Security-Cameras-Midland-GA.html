In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the concern have discovered that they have actually not minimized criminal activity. "When the crime and offense figures were adjusted to appraise the general down trend in crimes and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were noted in particular classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced criminal offense in general in the city centre."
