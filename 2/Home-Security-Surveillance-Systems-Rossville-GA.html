<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support authorities reaction to alarmed homes) a pricey and ineffective  approach to break-in decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
