As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
