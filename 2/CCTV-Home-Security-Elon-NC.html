<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
