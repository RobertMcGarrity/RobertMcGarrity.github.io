<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some individuals may say that we need to not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They claim that they get into privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. When a criminal offense has been captured on film, cameras are there not to invade a person's privacy but to secure the public by discouraging criminal activity and by offering product proof.</p>
<p>One category where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is client service.
