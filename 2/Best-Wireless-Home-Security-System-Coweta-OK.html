Aside from security, Outright Security Alarms has home automation products and options. 2GIG's control board can speak and manage simple home automation items like door locks, lighting, thermostats, and small device modules.</p>
<p>Some wireless security companies have extra features and plans for an added cost.

For instance, Scout just provides one security camera (and it's for indoor usage just). If you want a few more sets of eyes on your property, though, Scout Alarm integrates with Nest Cams, which can send motion notices to your Scout app.</p>
