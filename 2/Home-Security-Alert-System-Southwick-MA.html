<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
