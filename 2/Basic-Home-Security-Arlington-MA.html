<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
