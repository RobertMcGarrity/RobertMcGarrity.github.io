<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the police for an incorrect alarm. Considering that the house owner supervises of the system, authorities are only contacted if there's a real emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will call cops if a homeowner can't verify a false alarm. , if cops are called for an incorrect alarm, homeowners might have to pay a fine for dispatching authorities needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for false alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
