However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked only about 50 percent of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>
