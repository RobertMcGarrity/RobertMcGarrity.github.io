The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet economical systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and watch it later.

IP-based cameras perform the same function as analog ones, however with a host of additional abilities. IP cameras typically provide much better images with greater resolution and more versatility, enabling users to e-mail video images for assessment.

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
