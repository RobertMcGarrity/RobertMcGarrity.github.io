<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home abilities and compatibilities allow you to take advantage of their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. The arguments for and against CCTV cameras below are simply examples of comments that have actually been disputed, and are not created to reproduce views from IFSEC International and its group. Advanced sensing units detect motion inside your home and outdoors, listen for the noise of breaking glass to defend against trespassers and protect valuables. While many people utilize the term CCTV to describe both IP and analog cameras, strictly speaking, the term needs to be restricted to explaining analog cameras.</p>
<p>Though most of our attention these days is focused on the transition to IP video innovation, it is necessary to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly reliable for lots of surveillance applications, particularly those on a budget. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring place. However that does not mean you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disruption principle based on two unshielded (or 'leaking') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter produces constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is covert after installation. Care must be taken to guarantee the surrounding soil provides good drainage in order to prevent nuisance alarms.</p>
<p>Combined with effective new software application called video analytics, an IP security camera can be programmed to "watch" for suspicious activity. A camera on an air intake, for example, can be programmed to display a record and alert video only when the area around the intake is disturbed.

For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light inside or trigger an external siren when the camera spots motion.</p>
