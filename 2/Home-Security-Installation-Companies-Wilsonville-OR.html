<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras reduce crime. HD CCTV systems work with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

However that doesn't imply you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an infraction. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
