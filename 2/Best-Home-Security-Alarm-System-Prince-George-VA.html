<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring.

<h3>Home Security System Review in Virginia</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider location and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Door and window sensors are contact motion sensors that set off an alarm when the secured door or window opens.
